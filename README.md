# RedirectUnlocked
**RedirectUnlocked** is an project to save all the **malicious redirects** from the site **SteamUnlocked**, and its extremly easy for you to accidentally download malicious files and extensions that pretends to be the actual game, not to also say that downloading pirated stuff is one thing you really must trust the source to do it, as it is the most common way to get a virus.

## Why are you saving malicious stuff?
My purpose here is mostly to save it if someone wants to use it or inspect it (**_on a way that the person don't infect their own machine_**)
And not only that, i want to warn people about download there, i see that there are **MANY** people that trust on **SteamUnlocked**, and you should **NEVER** 100% trust anything that gives out pirated games, always check what site you are downloading, always check if you got into any fake download redirect and always check most of the files that seems to possibly have something strange on it on VirusTotal, always check everything you download from sites that are not from the official developers, i higly recommend to you support the developer with money instead of taking the risk! (at least that is what i prefer)

## The project maybe is ruined
Sooooo this is an update on 17 of october 2022 and... the antivirus on my computer (and the other collaborator computer) just don't want to accept the file, it just won't let download the file, i made EVERYTHING to try making the antivirus accept the file onto our computers, but the antivirus insists to not download malware, props to the antivirus tho _(BitDefender)_, because that means the antivirus actually works...       **i mean... i am using the paid version.**
