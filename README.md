# RedirectUnlocked
Samples of malicious redirects taken from Steamunlocked

RedirectUnlocked is an project by me WHATEVER to save the redirects that you may get on SteamUnlocked.
This idea came after knowing that so many people download virus instead of the actual game because of SteamUnlocked, and there are some fake installer everywhere on SteamUnlocked.
Always be careful when downloading stuff, even more if the site is shady.
More info soon.
